\section*{implementating BPMN with Camunda}

In this Workshop we will present you Camunda!
Camunda is a lightweight and open-source java-based Framework, to offer non-java developers a Rest API to build applications connecting to a remote workflow engine. It allows users to execute workflow tasks assigned to them.
